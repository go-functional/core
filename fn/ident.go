package fn

// ID is a function that takes in a value and immediately
// returns it without modification. This functionality,
// of course, is useless in most situations, but there
// exist scenarios where it is indeed useful. You'll
// know them when you see them.
// func ID[T any](t T) T {
// 	return t
// }
