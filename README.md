# Functional Programming Core Libraries for Go

This repository contains core libraries for functional programming in Go.

If you're interested, please contribute any way you wish. Here are some ideas:

- Submit an [issue](https://github.com/go-functional/core/issues) with a question, comment, or anything else
- Make a change and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/go-functional/core/pulls). Even if you aren't a "FP person" or don't know what you're doing, I want to hear what you think, and sometimes the best way to do that is through code :)
