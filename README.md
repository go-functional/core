# Functional Programming Core Libraries for Go

>**Not well maintained.** I started this repository a long time ago to experiment with functional programming concepts in Go. Since then, Go 1.18 was released with support for generics, which has enabled many, many more FP-style constructs to be written. I am continuing to experiment with them in this repository, but I can't claim that any of these things are going to work, or work well.

This repository contains core libraries for functional programming (FP) in Go. It aims to draw on FP theory to introduce useful functionality to the Go ecosystem. As such, you won't see strong support for all the FP structures like `Functor`s, `Monoid`s or `Monad`s here, but you'll see practical applications of the general functionality those concepts offer.

## Resources and Learning

Not many resources exist for learning how to apply FP concepts to Go. To learn more about the concepts herein, please see the following:

- [FP explained with Javascript](https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon)
- [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)

## Contributing

Realistically, as of this writing, this repository is for experimentation. I can't pay much attention to PRs and issues, so if you submit one of either, expect that it will stay open indefinitely.
